The program integrates digital tools, sustainable practices, and hands-on learning experiences to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice. This forward-thinking approach aims not only to boost student employability but also to foster innovative leadership in managing large-scale projects.</p> <h2>A Consortium of European Excellence</h2> <p>The DREAMER project is a collaborative effort among several prominent higher education institutions. The initiative is led by <strong>the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava</strong> and includes key partners such as:</p> <ul><li>Universitatea Națională de Știință și Tehnologie POLITEHNICA București</li> <li>Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv</li> <li>Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture</li> <li>Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego</li> <li>South East Technological University</li> <li>Zagreb School of Economics and Management</li></ul> <p>Additionally, <strong>Oracle Academy Croatia</strong> is participating as an associated partner, adding further expertise to the project.</p> <h2>Strategic Impact and Future Vision</h2> <p>One of the central aims of DREAMER is to address the critical shortage of qualified project managers—a gap that has significant implications for economic stability and sustainable development across Europe. In particular, the program is tailored to support reconstruction efforts in Ukraine by providing over 100 war-affected students with targeted training and practical experience in project management.</p>",1);function d(e){var t=o();n(16),a(e,t)}export{d as default,l as metadata};
