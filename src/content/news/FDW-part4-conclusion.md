On March 4, 2025, we wrapped up the final session of the DREAMER Faculty Development Workshop, bringing together educators and experts for an engaging and insightful discussion on digital learning and advanced project management tools.

The session began with **Cristian Tarba** (Universitatea Nationala de Stiinta si Tehnologie POLITEHNICA Bucuresti), who provided a hands-on guide on preparing video lectures that align with DREAMER project standards and demonstrated how to create effective webinars using MS Teams.

After a short break, we had the privilege of hosting **Arlene Van Tonder** (Vice President, Business Engineering, Construction and Engineering, Oracle) and **Matthew Ottaway** (Senior Director, Business Engineering EMEA, Oracle) for an exclusive deep dive into Oracle Primavera Cloud. Their session covered:
- The Primavera roadmap and its evolution
- A live demo of Oracle Primavera Cloud, showcasing its powerful project management capabilities
- A real-world case study, demonstrating how Primavera is transforming construction project management

The contribution of Oracle Academy representatives was truly invaluable, offering faculty members a first-hand look at industry-leading tools and methodologies that are shaping the future of project management and construction engineering.
With this session, the Faculty Development Workshop officially concluded, marking the end of an incredible learning journey. Thank you to all participants, presenters, and partners who made this initiative a success!

Stay tuned for more updates and opportunities from the DREAMER Project!
