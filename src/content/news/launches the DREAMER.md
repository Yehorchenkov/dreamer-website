In a major step forward for modern project management education, Erasmus+ has officially launched the DREAMER project—short for “Development and Reconstruction Empowerment through Advanced Project Management Education and Research.” Backed by a €400,000 grant, this ambitious three-year initiative is set to overhaul traditional project management training for students in fields such as construction, engineering, and business.

## A New Educational Paradigm

At the heart of the DREAMER project is a newly developed 32-ECTS curriculum designed to equip students with the skills needed to tackle complex, real-world projects. The program integrates digital tools, sustainable practices, and hands-on learning experiences to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice. This forward-thinking approach aims not only to boost student employability but also to foster innovative leadership in managing large-scale projects.

## A Consortium of European Excellence

The DREAMER project is a collaborative effort among several prominent higher education institutions. The initiative is led by **the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava** and includes key partners such as:

- Universitatea Națională de Știință și Tehnologie POLITEHNICA București
- Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv
- Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture
- Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego
- South East Technological University
- Zagreb School of Economics and Management

Additionally, **Oracle Academy Croatia** is participating as an associated partner, adding further expertise to the project.

## Strategic Impact and Future Vision

One of the central aims of DREAMER is to address the critical shortage of qualified project managers—a gap that has significant implications for economic stability and sustainable development across Europe. In particular, the program is tailored to support reconstruction efforts in Ukraine by providing over 100 war-affected students with targeted training and practical experience in project management.
