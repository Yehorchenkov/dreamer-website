The final two days of our DREAMER study visit have come to an end, wrapping up an inspiring and knowledge-packed event!

We had the pleasure of hosting a presentation from **Adam Filo - the former project manager of the BIDs Zwirn development**, who shared valuable insights from his experience leading this transformative project.

We were also honoured to welcome **Peter Mikoláš, PMP – President of PMI Slovakia Chapter** – who joined us for an engaging discussion on professional project management practices.

Throughout the visit, we continued discussions on the development of the educational module within the DREAMER project, including content structure, delivery formats, and collaborative teaching approaches.

To top it off, our group visited EIT Manufacturing in Vienna, where we explored the features of cross-border innovation projects and learned about the specific challenges of managing such initiatives.

Thank you to all speakers, participants, and partners who made these days so impactful!
