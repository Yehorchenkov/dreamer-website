## General Information

**From October 1, 2024 – Bratislava, Slovakia**

The Erasmus+ program has announced the launch of the **DREAMER Project (Development and Reconstruction Empowerment through Advanced Project Management Education and Research)**, an initiative aimed at reshaping project management education while supporting Ukraine's post-war recovery. With a three-year timeline (2024–2027), this project unites top universities across Europe and Ukraine to address critical global challenges in sustainability, digital innovation, and education.

Led by the **SPECTRA Centre of Excellence EU of Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava (STUBA)**, the DREAMER project is a collaboration between institutions in Romania, Poland, Ireland, Croatia, and Ukraine. Together, they aim to address the shortage of skilled project managers needed to navigate the complexities of clean energy, digital transformation, and sustainable development.

**Project No 2024-1-SK01-KA220-HED-000248287**

## Key Goals of the DREAMER Project

- **Support Ukraine’s Rebuilding Efforts.** Equip a new generation of project managers to lead reconstruction and development projects in Ukraine, estimated to require €1 trillion in investment.

- **Drive Educational Innovation.** Introduce student-centered, challenge-based learning approaches with an emphasis on digital and green skills.

- **Foster International Collaboration.** Strengthen academic networks across Europe and Ukraine, promoting joint research and knowledge sharing.

- **Promote Sustainability.** Embed environmentally conscious practices in project management education to align with global climate goals.
